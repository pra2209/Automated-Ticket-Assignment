# Automated-Ticket-Assignment
NLP project to automatically detect the category of IT incident and allocate to the right functional group for resolution

In this project, the goal is to build a classifier that can classify the tickets by analyzing text.

Pre-Processing, Data Visualization and EDA
● Exploring the given Data files
● Understanding the structure of data
● Missing points in data
● Finding inconsistencies in the data
● Visualizing different patterns
● Visualizing different text features
● Dealing with missing values
● Text preprocessing
● Creating word vocabulary from the corpus of report text data
● Creating tokens as required

Model Building
● Building a model architecture which can classify.
● Trying different model architectures by researching state of the art for similar tasks.
● Train the model
● To deal with large training time, save the weights so that you can use them when training the model for the second time without starting from scratch.

Test the Model, Fine-tuning and Repeat 
● Test the model and report as per evaluation metrics 
● Try different models ● Try different evaluation metrics 
● Set different hyper parameters, by trying different optimizers, loss functions, epochs, learning rate, batch size, checkpointing, early stopping etc..for these models to fine-tune them 
● Report evaluation metrics for these models along with your observation on how changing different hyper parameters leads to change in the final evaluation metric.
